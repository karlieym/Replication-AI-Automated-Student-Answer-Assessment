This means that the substance being transported will be on the higher side of the concentration gradient and be pushed across the membrane so that both sides will be at a state of equilibrium. The second type is active transport. This means the substance will be pushed against the membrane, from being in a less dense to more dense side. This takes energy from the cell and usually happens at a certain point in the membrane where the substances can bind with a certain type of enzyme.The third type is osmosis.

When a cell has to use active transport, it has to do something to let the object, or liquid, into the cell.  It has to use channel proteins to allow it in.

Simple diffusion involves substances (such as water) located in an area with a high concentration of that substance to move to a location with a lower concentration of said substance.  For example, if there is a high concentration of water inside the cell, and a lower concentration outside the cell, then water will pass through the cell's membrane and go outside the cell.     Cells also use facillitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane.  Facillitated diffusion moves substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.  This type of diffusion requires energy.     Cells also have special transporting proteins in their membranes that help move large substances into and out of the cell.  These types of substances would be too large to pass through the cell membrane just through diffusion.",1,"This student answer should receive a score of 2 points.

The student correctly identified that plastic type B and D had similar stretchability based on their data, which is a valid conclusion drawn from the investigation. However, the student mentioned ways to improve the experimental design without fully describing them.

Reasoning:
The student correctly analyzed the data from the investigation and drew valid conclusions about the stretchability of the different plastic samples. However, the student's description of how the experiment could have been improved is not clear or accurate.

The student correctly identifies that plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability, aligning with the key elements. They also mention the need for improvements in the experimental design by suggesting not to use tape to hold the plastic and to try different amounts of weights for different times, addressing the need for additional trials and variation in weight, which are key elements.

The student correctly identified that plastic sample B was the strongest type of plastic in terms of stretchability.

Reasoning:
The student answer did not mention any of the key elements provided in the question. The student mentioned that mRNA carries the protein to the nucleus, which is incorrect as mRNA carries the genetic information from the nucleus to the ribosome for protein synthesis.

Osmosis is the crossing of water through the cell membrane and diffusion is the crossing of other things.  One way that a cell allows things into it is active transport.  When a cell has to use active transport, it has to do something to let the object, or liquid, into the cell.  It has to use channel proteins to allow it in.  Another way that cells let things cross through the membrane is through passive transport.  Passive transport is more layed back and happens easier than active transport.",2,"The student answer matches the following key elements:
1. Selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across.
2. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.
3. Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane.

Reasoning:
The student correctly identified passive transport as the movement of substances from an area of high concentration to low concentration, and active transport as the process that requires energy to move molecules across the membrane. However, the student only mentioned two key elements out of the three required in the question. Therefore, they receive 2 points according to the rubric.",2

- Selective permeability (cell membrane allows water in but keeps out other substances)
- Osmosis (process of bringing in water to the cell)
- Active transport (cell uses active transport to bring in nutrients)

Rule applied from the Rubric:
2 points: Two key elements

Reasoning:
The student answer includes two out of the three key elements required in the question: selective permeability and osmosis. The description of active transport is somewhat incomplete and not entirely accurate, as it mentions bringing in nutrients that are not normally used, which does not fully align with the key element of active transport.

Reasoning:
The student only mentioned passive transport occurring from one cell to another, which matches with the key element about substances moving from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. The student did not mention any other processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, so only one key element is matched, resulting in a score of 1 point.",1

Reasoning:
The student answer mentions two processes: ""chromosome"" and ""cell division prophase"", neither of which are related to the control of movement of substances across the cell membrane. However, the second part of the answer ""cell divison prophase"" could potentially be interpreted as referring to some form of cellular division, which could be relevant to the question.

Reasoning:
The student answer includes descriptions of facilitated diffusion, osmosis, and active transport, which match three key elements from the key elements list.

In the case of facilitated diffusion, the student mentions proteins allowing water and larger molecules through the membrane by diffusion, which is partially correct but incomplete regarding the role of proteins. For osmosis, the student mentions the regulation of molecules on either side of the membrane but doesn't fully describe the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane.
